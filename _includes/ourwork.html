            <p>SOCAFRICA contacted AAS for a partner to assist with its mission to engage with populations across Africa, understand the circulation of information and disinformation, and communicate effectively. AAS worked with SOCAFRICA to understand the unique needs of an international environment, and awarded a five-year, Phase II Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contract. This award allows SOCAFRICA to communicate through a number of formal and informal channels, and to understand what information other countries are disseminating on the African continent. In the COVID-19 era, this work also allows the United States to stay engaged through remote surveys and new digital communications tools.</p>

        <div class="roundedCard-blue">
            <p>AAS strengthens and supports America’s supply chains by awarding a “first of its kind” enterprise contract to Exiger, streamlining access to a commonly used supply chain risk tool capability across the DOD, and other government agencies that share the Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) space.<br>
            The task order supports SCRM analysis across the Federal Government. AAS executed the task order for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD A&S) in record time. The software as a service (SaaS) SCRM contract provides a flexible and direct contracting pathway for all government agencies to quickly obtain technology and expertise to identify and manage risk, using the Exiger software. The platform ensures the ability to leverage volume discounts, government-wide enterprise data-sharing, improved collaboration and risk mitigation, and sharing best practices in supply chain risk mitigation to promote efficiency and decrease waste.</p>
