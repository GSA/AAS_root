            <p>AAS provided urgent support to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in response to pandemic requirements since 2020. The team worked with cross-functional stakeholders to plan for and execute legal responses to the request, engage employees outside of the usual acquisitions team to adjust to shifts in workload. Their hard work paid off with three awards to HHS in partnership with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and included modifications to the existing HHS CDC 1-800 COVID contract. This work increased Managed Contact Center services for the CDC INFO program and provided vaccine assistance through voice and text channels. The team also made a new award, the HHS CDC 8(a) COVID-19 Diagnostic Informatics contract, which expands COVID testing capabilities in public schools. All of these efforts were made ahead of schedule, demonstrating AAS's embodiment of the AAS values and critical support to the agency at the forefront of the nation's COVID-19 response.</p>

            <p>AAS strengthens and supports America’s supply chains by awarding a “first of its kind” enterprise contract to Exiger, streamlining access to a commonly used supply chain risk tool capability across the DOD, and other government agencies that share the Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) space.<br>
            The TO supports SCRM analysis across the Federal Government. AAS executed the task order for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD A&S) in record time. The software as a service (SaaS) SCRM contract provides a flexible and direct contracting pathway for all government agencies to quickly obtain technology and expertise to identify and manage risk, using the Exiger software. The platform ensures the ability to leverage volume discounts, government-wide enterprise data-sharing, improved collaboration and risk mitigation, and sharing best practices in supply chain risk mitigation to promote efficiency and decrease waste.</p>
