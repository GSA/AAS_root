        <h3 id="question_1">1) QUESTION: What does ASTRO stand for?
        </h3>
        <p><b>RESPONSE: </b>The ASTRO name is not an acronym.</p>

        <h3 id="question_2">2) QUESTION: What is the value proposition for using ASTRO?</h3>
        <p><b>RESPONSE: </b>ASTRO provides a streamlined acquisition platform for leveraged buying of platform related services. Taxpayers, Federal agencies, and Industry will benefit in cost savings from consistent, standardized terms and conditions; a reduction in the numbers of master contracts requiring award and administration, streamlined and flexible ordering procedures, standardized labor categories, and robust competition.</p>

        <h3 id="question_3">3) QUESTION: What is the ceiling of the ASTRO contracts?</h3>
        <p><b>RESPONSE: </b>The ASTRO contracts were awarded on authority of an approved FAR deviation from the requirement to establish a contract maximum orders value or ceiling. There is no ceiling and agencies can safely assume ASTRO will cover all of their in-scope service requirements, no matter the aggregate value.</p>

        <h3 id="question_5">5) QUESTION: What contract types are available under the ASTRO contracts?</h3>
        <p><b>RESPONSE: </b>All contract pricing types in FAR Part 16, fixed-price (F-P) with and without incentives, cost-reimbursement (C-R) with and without incentives, time-and-materials (T&M), and labor-hour (L-H) contract as well as hybrids of these types, are permissible for orders. OCO's may also utilize more than one contract type in an order by identifying a CLIN for F-P, C-R and/or T&M, as appropriate.</p>
        <p><i><a href="#questions">Back to Top</a></i></p>
        <hr class="faqLine">
        <br>

        <h3 id="question_6">6) QUESTION: What is the preferred contract type for ASTRO? Do orders have to be firm-fixed price, performance based?</h3>
        <p><b>RESPONSE: </b>No. Choosing an appropriate contract type for each order is essential to successful performance. The type of contract determines the pricing methodology as well as the cost and performance risks placed on the contractor. If appropriate, the order should be firm-fixed price. However, the goal is to select the contract type and acquisition approach that will optimize risk sharing between the parties and result in the most favorable outcome.</P>
        <p>The FAR 37.102 based order of precedence is:
            <ol type="i">
                <li>A firm-fixed price performance-based task order.</li>
                <li>A performance-based task order that is not firm-fixed price.</li>
                <li>A task order that is not performance-based.</li>

        <h3 id="question_7">7) QUESTION: Can I purchase tools, equipment or other commodities as part of my service-based solution?</h3>
        <p><b>RESPONSE: </b>Yes, the ASTRO contracts allow ancillary support to include tools, equipment, hardware, software and other commodities such as licenses, maintenance, etc. to be acquired under one order if integral to and necessary for the in-scope service-based solution.

        <br>

        <h3 id="question_8">8) QUESTION: Who can place orders under the ASTRO contracts?</h3>
        <p><b>RESPONSE: </b>Currently, the ASTRO contracts are available for use by all General Services Administration (GSA) Assisted Acquisition Ordering Officers who have obtained a Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA) from the ASTRO Program Office. Contract Specialists/Contracting Officers who have received training from the applicable ASTRO contracting officer or his/her duly authorized representative are authorized to use the ASTRO contracts. However, only a duly warranted Contracting Officer with an ASTRO DPA can sign the ASTRO task order.</P>
        <p>ASTRO training must be completed as part of the delegation process.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id="question_9">9) QUESTION: Must I provide fair opportunity to all ASTRO contractors for each and every order?</h3>
        <p><b>RESPONSE: </b>No. You must provide fair opportunity to all ASTRO contractors within the Pool applicable to your task order requirement for every order exceeding $3,000 unless one of the exceptions to fair opportunity as listed in FAR subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(A) through (F) applies.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id="question_10">10) QUESTION: Are there dollar limitations or percentages on each order for ancillary support?
        </h3>
        <p><b>RESPONSE: </b>No. The ASTRO contracts do not contain any dollar or percentage (based on the total order value) limitations for ancillary support. While this offers tremendous flexibility, the OCO must remember that the primary purpose/outcome of the task order must be an in-scope services-based solution and the ancillary support must be integral and necessary to the requirement.

            <ol type="A">
                <li>A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or</li>
                <li>A protest of an order valued in excess of $10 million. Protests of orders in excess of $10 million may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office, in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.</li>

        <h3 id="question_12">12) QUESTION: Are construction services allowed under the ASTRO contracts?</h3>
        <p><b>RESPONSE: </b>Yes, so long as the work is integral and necessary to the in-scope services requirement. Please bear in mind that ASTRO is not a construction contract and that services that fall under the Brooks Act are not authorized under ASTRO.</p>

        <h3 id="question_13">13) QUESTION: Are leases allowed under the ASTRO contracts?</h3>
        <p><b>RESPONSE: </b>Yes. The Government contemplates that leases may be part of a task order solution offered by a Contractor, but the Government, where the Contractor's solution includes leasing, must not be the Lessee. Under no circumstances on any task order awarded under ASTRO shall the Government be deemed to have privity-of-contract with the Owner/Lessor of the Leased Items; or, the Government be held liable for early Termination/Cancellation damages if the Government decides not to exercise an option period under a task order unless the Contractor has specifically disclosed the amount of such damages (or the formula by which such damages would be calculated) as part of its proposal and the OCO for the task order has specifically approved/allowed such damages as part of the task order terms and conditions.</p>

        <h3 id="question_14">14) QUESTION: Are ASTRO contractors required to meet a minimum facility security clearance?</h3>
        <p><b>RESPONSE: </b>No, however, OCO's (Ordering Contracting Officer) may specify any level of facility or personnel clearance required for their order. In addition, OCOs should clearly identify any clearance level required as a condition for award and request appropriate verification as part of their Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>

        <h3 id="question_15">15) QUESTION: What NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) code was used to award the ASTRO contracts and do I need to use this code on my order?</h3>
